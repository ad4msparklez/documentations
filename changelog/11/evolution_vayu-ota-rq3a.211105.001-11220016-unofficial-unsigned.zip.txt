Build date: 22/11/2021
==================================================
Credits:
- Thanks to @SebaUbuntu for OSS trees
- Thanks to @kubersharma001 for his trees
- Thanks to @nullxception for his awesome kernel
- Thanks to @fryevia, @alanndz, @Vrasteizz, and @Suzurui for their help
- Thanks to @GengKapak for their support
- Thanks to all my tester
==================================================
Notes:
- Dirty flash it's okay.
- SafetyNet passed (without Magisk).
- Already include GApps, no need to flash GApps again.
- You can use any firmware version, 12.0.X or 12.5.X doesn't matter, it will boot. Choose your favorite firmware.
- If you ask my firmware version, I'm using V12.0.1.0-RJUIDXM (the old one from Indonesian region).
- From this build and next build, I will use (my own custom version), 5.9.3 is previous build and now is 5.9.4 (EvolutionX source still 5.9.3, they didn't change it yet).
- Since this is unofficial build and EvolutionX team didn't change their version yet, so I think it's okay to change version (just to make it simple how to call it).
- My Android 11 journey almost finished, (I think) my build stable AF (I hope).
- Don't ask Android 12 yet, I'm busy!! :(
